To fix the specificity issue, you need to understand the order of precedence for CSS selectors. ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors, which in turn are higher than element selectors.  If you need to override styling based on a class or element selector, you can increase its specificity by adding more selectors to it. For example, making the class selector more specific by making it:

```css
div.special p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

Using `!important` is generally discouraged, but it's sometimes necessary as a last resort when dealing with tricky specificity issues. A better solution would be to restructure your CSS selectors or HTML to avoid the conflict.  If you have multiple classes on your div, you might have a more specific selector that does not conflict with the other ones. For example:

```css
.special.anotherclass p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, the `anotherclass` class increases the specificity of the selector, allowing it to override the other less specific selectors.
