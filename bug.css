The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The unexpected behavior arises from the overlapping specificity of selectors, causing unexpected styling overrides.

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.special p {
  color: red;
}

#special-id p {
  color: green;
}

<div id="special-id" class="special">
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

The paragraph within the div will be green. The `#special-id p` selector has higher specificity than `.special p` and `div p`.
